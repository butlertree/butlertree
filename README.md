# 👋 Hey there, I'm Chris - @butlertree

Welcome to my slice of GitHub - a place where my past as a meteorologist and educator meets my present and future in tech.

### A Bit About Me
- 👀 **What piques my interest?** Simple: problem-solving, learning, and building. Whether it's a complex coding challenge or figuring out how to best convey a concept, I'm there.
- 🌱 **Currently on my learning journey:** I'm delving deeper into React and React Native. Always curious, always learning.
- 💞️ **Keen to collaborate on** projects that make a difference. Education tech? Environmental solutions? Community-driven platforms? Count me in.
- 📫 **Reach out and say hi!** Drop me an email at butlertree@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbutler). Let's share ideas and inspire each other.
- 😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** Outside of tech, you might find me coaching youth basketball, planning my next hiking adventure, or knee-deep in a home DIY project. Balance is key, and I believe in living a full, vibrant life.

### Projects & Passions
My projects are a mix of my interests, skills, and the desire to impact positively:
- **WeatherTogether**: Marrying my background in meteorology with my tech skills for a gamified weather prediction platform.
- **Aerobites**: Leveraging my travels and love for aviation to enhance the airport experience through an app.
- **Digital Dog Park**: Combining community building with my affection for dogs, creating a space for pet lovers to connect.

### Why I Love Tech
Tech is a field that never stands still, and neither do I. It's about continuous learning, adapting, and applying yourself in new ways. My diverse background has taught me to look at problems from different angles, to be resilient, and to value teamwork. I'm excited to bring these qualities to the tech world, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue growing.

### Let's Make Something Great Together
I believe in the power of collaboration to create something greater than the sum of its parts. If you're working on something exciting or share similar interests, I'd love to hear from you. Let's see what we can build together!
